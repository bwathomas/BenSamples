This is a straightforward collection of simple coding exercises in C++ and Python. These were picked because I think 
they are simple to read, and showcase a strong understanding of programming fundamentals for data science
and algorithm design. These are both (slightly modified) homework assignments, so these both represent approximately an afternoon of work.
